	This folder contains the Relative Solvent Accessibilities (RSA) for the CRYSTAL STRUCTURE (not MD trajectories) of the proteins that are considered in this work. The *.rsa files are generated by the python code calculate_rsa.py and the *.dssp are DSSP output files generated during calculate_rsa.py runtime.
