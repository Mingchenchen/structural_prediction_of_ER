	This directory contains the calculated entropies using amino acid sequence alignments data in the directory 'evolutionary rates' provided by Stephanie for the all (~9) protein families. The python code that generates the entropy files for each protein family is in the subdirectory "src".
	
	To run the code, type the following on the command line:
		
		python sequence_entropy.py
		
	The code will automatically inform you of the required input command line arguments needed.
