	This folder contains pdb files of the structures for MD trajectories have been generated. The naming convension is the following: The name of the pdb structure, followed by the chain ID indicator (if available), followed by the ionized pdb structure indicator '_I_' (if any sodium or chloride ions exist in the pdb file), followed by the suffix '_bres' which indicates that the pdb file has been generated from the original pdb file AFTER being modified and corrected by the Amber software tleap. The tleap software removes the chain ID of the pdb file and adds any missing atoms to the residues and changes the three-letter naming convention of some of the residues. The bres files are the same as the Amber-tleap modified pdb files except that the naming convention is reversed to the original pdb convention for compatibility with other software such as VMD and DSSP.
	
	The bres files can generated by typing the following example line (for pdb 2FP7_B) on a TACC Lonestar command line:
	
		ambpdb -bres -p 2FP7_B_cpptraj.prmtop <$WORK/setup/2FP7_B.inpcrd> 2FP7_B_bres.pdb
		
	or (for pdb 1RD8):
		
		ambpdb -bres -p 1RD8_I_cpptraj.prmtop <$WORK/setup/1RD8_I.inpcrd> 1RD8_I_amber.pdb
		
	
	
	The flow of the pdb file generation is the following:
	
							Amber tleap										ambpdb						Fortran codes
	original pdb: *.pdb  ----------------->  Amber pdb:  *_amber.pdb  ----------------->  *_bres.pdb   ----------------->  *_X.pdb
