# COMMAND LINE: cpptraj $WORK/setup/2JLY_IS.prmtop 2JLY_cpptraj_image.in
# Note: the input pdb file must be present in the directory where cpptraj is run (directory containing mdcrd files).
# This code first strips water molecules from the topology file.
# Then write out the new topology file in a new prmtop file for future reference.
# Then corrects the atom positions for any out of box visualization errors, and combines all mdcrd files generated by Amber MD into one single corrected file named '*_image.mdcrd' for further future analysis.
