# USAGE --> TYPE IN TACC LONESTAR COMMAND LINE:  cpptraj $WORK/setup/3I5K_IS.prmtop 3I5K_A_rmsf.in
# Note: the input pdb file must be present in the directory where cpptraj is run (directory containing mdcrd files).
# This code first strips water molecules and ions (Na+ and Cl-) from the topology file.
# Then uses the topology file to calculate the RMSD and RMSD_per_residue (RMSF) of the given structure.
# ATTN:  The calculated RMSD and RMSF is based on the fluctuations of ONLY the CA atoms of the protein backbone.
