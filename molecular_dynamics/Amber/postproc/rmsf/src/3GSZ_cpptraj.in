# COMMAND LINE: cpptraj $WORK/setup/3GSZ_IS.prmtop 3GSZ_cpptraj_1.in
# Note: the input pdb file must be present in the directory where cpptraj is run (directory containing mdcrd files).
# This code first strips water molecules from the topology file.
# Then write out the new topology file in a new prmtop file for future reference.
# Then reads in the input pdb file generated by tleap in the "setup" directory.
# Then calculates the residue fluctuations with reference to the input pdb file.
# Then creates and writes out an average structure from the input mdcrd files.
# Then calculates the residue fluctuations with reference to the average pdb file.
