This directory contains the (Amber cpptraj output) rmsf (root-mean-square-fluctuation per residue) files. Each file's name is detemined by the pdb_id + file_content (here, rmsf) + and the reference frame with respect to which the rmsf was calculated (inpcrd: the initial pdb coordinate file for MD simulation).
