This folder contains the Weighted Contact Number summary values (WCN) for each amino acid (AA) of each protein structure that have MD simulation trajectories. The total number of MD trajectories are 1500 frames for each structure. The first line of data, represented by frame 0, corresponds to the crystal structure taken from the protein data bank.

WCN is defined by the paper (2012) by some chinese guys (hard to recognize their names from each other!) the sum of the inverse square distances of all CA carbons from the CA carbons of the AA considered.
