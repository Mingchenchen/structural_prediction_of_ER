	This directory contains pdb files that are modified versions of the *_bres.pdb files generated by Amber in the preceding directory. Any of the Fortran codes written to calculate the contact numbers or ASA values automatically generate the *_X.pdb files from the corresponding input *_bres.pdb files by adding an ad hoc chain ID 'X' to the *_bres.pdb files in order to make them readable for VMD, DSSP or other software.

	
	The flow of the pdb file generation is the following:
	
							Amber tleap										ambpdb						Fortran codes
	original pdb: *.pdb  ----------------->  Amber pdb:  *_amber.pdb  ----------------->  *_bres.pdb   ----------------->  *_X.pdb
