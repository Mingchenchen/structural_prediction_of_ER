This directory contains the reformatted (Amber output) pdb files without TER lines in the pdb. TER statements are removed from the pdb files in order to make the entire MD-simulated pdb as a single chain (determined by id 'X').

These pdb files can be used as input for DSSP to calculated RSA.

As of today there are 10 pdb files in this directory for MD simulation trajectories are available.
