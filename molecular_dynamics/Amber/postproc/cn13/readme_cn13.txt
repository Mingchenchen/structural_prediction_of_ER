This folder contains Contact Number summary values (CN) for each amino acid (AA) of each protein structure that have MD simulation trajectories. The total number of MD trajectories are 1500 frames for each structure. The first line of data, represented by frame 0, corresponds to the crystal structure taken from the protein data bank.

CN is defined by Franzosa and Xia (2009) as the number of alpha carbons (CA) that are closer than 13 angstroms to the alpha carbon of the desired amino acid. The file extensions cn13, highlight the distance used for the calculation of CN.
