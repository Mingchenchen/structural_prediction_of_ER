	This folder contains Accessible Surface Area (asa) for each amino acid (aa) of each protein structure that have MD simulation trajectories. The total number of MD trajectories are 1500 frames for each structure.

	Each row in every *.asa file represents the ASA of the protein amino acids for the MD trajectory frame which is determined by its number in the first column, followed by the ASA values for each amino acid.
	the asa files are obtained using the Fortran (2008) source codes that are in the subdirectory 'src'.
	
	To compile the Fortran code and create the executable on TACC, use the following command:
	
		> ifort main_dynamic_asa.f90 -o main_dynamic_asa.o
	
	The main code has a dependent subroutine which is in the file 'sub_asa_outputter.f90'

	To run the code type:
	
		> main_dynamic_asa.o
		
	The code will automatically inform the user about the required command-line input file names in order to generate the asa values.
	
	The first two moments (mean and variance and median) of the asa values from MD trajectories for each protein residue are summarized in the corresponding summary files in the subdirectory 'asa_summaries'.

		The input pdb file to the code must be the modified pdb file generated by Amber that has ALL the atoms added to the original pdb structure prior to the MD simulation. A qualified pdb file is the one with a file name that ends with either *_bres.pdb or *_amber.pdb. The former is preferred as the input, since the generated output pdb file by the code will then have three-letter amino acid names that are consistent with and recognized by other software packages such as VMD.
