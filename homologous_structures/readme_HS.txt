This folder contains all the work related to RMSF derived from homologous crystal structures. This work was done by by Dariya Sydykova.

The subfolders contain the following information:
- alignments
    Sequence alignments of homologous structures at various
    sequence-divergence cutoffs.
    
- pdb_availability
    Summary tables from blast search.

- rmsf
    RMSF values calculated from structural alignments of homologous structures.

- trees
    Phylogenetic trees for the sequence alignments.

- blast_hits
    Raw blast results.
    
- src
    All analysis scripts used to carry out the work.
    
- weights
    Phylogenetic weights calculated from the trees in "trees."
