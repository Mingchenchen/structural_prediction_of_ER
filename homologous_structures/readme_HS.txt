This folder contains all the work related to RMSF derived from homologous crystal structures. This work was done by by Dariya Sydykova.

Contents of directories:
	
rmsf/
	RMSF calculations from structural alignments of homologous structures with 5 or more sequences at 5% difference of aligned amino acids. RMSFs were calculated by src/get_rmsf.r using sequences in alignments/. The naming convention '*_HS.rmsf' here means RMSF values from Homologous Structures, mapped to the representative structure. Here * indicates the name of the representative structure.
	First column of data in these files 'res_num' is the residue number in the representative structure.
	Second column of data in these files 'res_name' is the residue name in the representative structure.
	Third column of data in these files 'rmsf' is the site-specific rmsf value measured using homologous 

alignments/
	Sequence alignments of homologous structures at various sequence-divergence cutoffs. Each folder contains:
	- *_all_relevan_seq.fa - contains aligned sequences from blast_hits/cutoff_blast_hits/*_cutoff_blast_hits.csv
	- *_all_unique_seq.fa - contains all unique sequences from *_all_relevan_seq.fa
	- *_10%_unique_seq.fa - contains sequences with 10% difference in aligned amino acids from *_all_relevan_seq.fa
	- *_5%_unique_seq.fa - contains sequences with 5% difference in aligned amino acids from *_all_relevan_seq.fa
	- *_2%_unique_seq.fa - contains sequences with 2% difference in aligned amino acids from *_all_relevan_seq.fa
	Here * represents abbreviation of the viral protein name (ex: Hepatitis C Protease - HCP).

blast_hits/
	BLAST output for all viral sequences in the table format. 
	all_blast_hits/
		Contains raw tables that are reported by BLAST when a homologous sequence is blasted against the Protein Data Bank. 
	cutoff_blast_hits/
		Contains altered all_blast_hits tables with cutoffs imposed based on the identity and alignment length values. Detailed description of the cutoff imposed is contained in cutoff_blast_hits/cutoffs.txt manually for each homologous structure. 
	
pdb_availability/
	Text files that track the number of homologous structures present for BLAST outputs and assorted alignments. This folder also contains all_pdb_availability.txt that captures available structures for all the viral proteins analyzed. 

trees/
    Phylogenetic trees used to calculate weights for the sequence alignments. These files were generated by RAxML. 

weights/
    Phylogenetic weights calculated from the trees in "trees." These weights were generated by src/get_weights.r.

src/
    All analysis scripts used to carry out the work. 
    - calculate_pdb_availability.sh
    	Finds all BLAST results for a given homologous structure and generates tables in blast_hits/.
		Downloads all necessary homologous structures from PDB to carry out further analysis.
		Generates alignments in alignments/.
    	Calculates homologous structure availability in pdb_availability/.
    - calculate_rmsf.sh
    	Runs RAxML to get phylogenetic trees in trees/.
    	Calculates weights from phylogenetic trees in trees/ and stores them in weights/.
    	Calculates RMSF in rmsf/.
    - paramlist_calculate_pdb_availability.sh
    	Runs calculate_pdb_availability.sh for all homologous structures considered.
    - paramlist_calculate_rmsf.sh
    	Runs calculate_rmsf.sh for homologous structures with structural alignments of 5 or more sequences at 5% difference of aligned amino acids.
