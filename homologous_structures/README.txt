This directory contains primarily the works of Daria on homologous structures, such as common-residue rmsf among homologous structures in a protein family. At present, due to the lack of a sufficient number of pdb crystal structures in the same protein families with high sequence similarity, Daria has considered only four protein families, out of which three have MD simulations for of one of the family's representative structures. The last family - West Nile Virus (2FP7_B) - might be reconsidered for MD simulations in the very near future as soon as I figure out why I did consider it for MD from the very beginning.
