This directory contains the evolutionary rates calculated using the default method of the software rate4site (the slow version of the code compiled through Makefile_slow). An example command line argument that is used to generate the rates is:

	~/Downloads/rate4site.3.2.source/sourceMar09/rate4site -t ~/git/structural_prediction_of_ER/evolutionary_rates/trees/tree_H1N1_HA.tre -s ~/git/structural_prediction_of_ER/evolutionary_rates/alignments/aminoacid/aln_aa_H1N1_HA.fasta -x ~/git/structural_prediction_of_ER/evolutionary_rates/rate4site/HP.tree -y ~/git/structural_prediction_of_ER/evolutionary_rates/rate4site/HP.rates

The naming convention for the output tree and rates files of each of the structures follows those of the README file in the root directory of the repository.
