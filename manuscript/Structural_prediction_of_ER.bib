	abstract = {The relative solvent accessibility ({RSA)} of a residue in a protein measures the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the {3D} structure. {RSA} is frequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties. To calculate {RSA}, a residue's solvent accessibility ({ASA)} needs to be normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do not provide tight upper bounds on {ASA} values frequently observed in empirical crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed {ASA} values, by up to 20\%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues that seem to have {RSA} values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed {ASA} values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published {ASA} normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that maximize {ASA} had not been correctly identified. As an application of our results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive to accurate {RSA} calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.},

	abstract = {During biosynthesis, a globular protein folds into a tight particle with an interior core that is shielded from the surrounding solvent. The hydrophobic effect is thought to play a key role in mediating this process: nonpolar residues expelled from water engender a molecular interior where they can be buried. Paradoxically, results of earlier quantitative analyses have suggested that the tendency for nonpolar residues to be buried within proteins is weak. However, such analyses merely classify residues as either "exposed" or "buried." In the experiment reported in this article proteins of known structure were used to measure the average area that each residue buries upon folding. This characteristic quantity, the average area buried, is correlated with residue hydrophobicity.},

	abstract = {The solvent-accessible surface area (As) of 46 monomeric proteins is calculated using atomic co-ordinates from high-resolution and well-refined crystal structures. The As of these proteins can be determined to within 1 to 2 \% and that of their individual residues to within 10 to 20\%.
The As values of proteins are correlated with their molecular weight (Mr) in the range 4000 to 35,000: the power law As = 6.3 M0.73 predicts protein As values to within 4\% on average. The average water-accessible surface is found to be 57\% non-polar, 24\% polar and 19\% charged, with 5\% root-mean-square variations. The molecular surface buried inside the protein is 58\% non-polar, 39\% polar and 4\% charged. The buried surface contains more uncharged polar groups (mostly peptides) than the surface that remains accessible, but many fewer charged groups.
On average, 15\% of residues in small proteins and 32\% in larger ones may be classed as “buried residues”, having less than 5\% of their surface accessible to the solvent. The accessibilities of most other residues are evenly distributed in the range 5 to 50\%. Although the fraction of buried residues increases with molecular weight, the amino acid compositions of the protein interior and surface show no systematic variation with molecular weight, except for small proteins that are often very rich in buried cysteines.
From amino acid compositions of protein surfaces and interiors we calculate an effective coefficient of partition for each type of residue, and derive an implied set of transfer free energy values. This is compared with other sets of partition coefficients derived directly from experimental data. The extent to which groups of residues (charged, polar and non-polar) are buried within proteins correlates well with their hydrophobicity derived from amino acid transfer experiments. Within these three groups, the correlation is low.},

Generating the conservation profile of a sequence requires aligning families of homologous sequences and having knowledge of their evolutionary relationships. Here, we report that the conservation profile at the residue level can be quantitatively derived from a single protein structure with only backbone information. We found that the reciprocal packing density profiles of protein structures closely resemble their sequence conservation profiles. For a set of 554 nonhomologous enzymes, 74\% (408/554) of the proteins have a correlation coefficient {\textgreater} 0.5 between these two profiles. Our results indicate that the three-dimensional structure, instead of being a mere scaffold for positioning amino acid residues, exerts such strong evolutionary constraints on the residues of the protein that its profile of sequence conservation essentially reflects that of its structural characteristics.

	abstract = {Incorporation of effective backbone sampling into protein simulation and design is an important step in increasing the accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model, termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this model of backbone flexibility using three different tests. First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in natural proteins. Application of this simple model of backbone motions may significantly improve both protein design and atomistic simulations of localized protein flexibility.},
