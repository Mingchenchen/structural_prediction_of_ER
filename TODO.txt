Things to do:

- Describe file naming convention in top-level README.txt (Amir)
	Note by Amir: Done, August 2013
	
- Deposit master table listing viruses and structures to analyze (Dariya)
	Note by Amir: Done, August 2013
	
- Verify/fix/re-obtain sequence alignments for HIV RT, West Nile protease, Rift Valley fever (Stephanie)
	Note by Amir: Done by Stephanie, August 2013

- Choose reference structures, update Dariya's table accordingly (Austin, in consultation with Dariya and Amir)
	Note by Amir: Done by invisible hand of God in an anonymous collaboration with Austin, Daria and Amir, August 2013

- Calculate omega using REL model, 5 categories (Stephanie)
	Note by Amir: Apparently it is done by Stephanie (needs confirmation)

- Calculate site entropy and site entropy of filtered alignments (removing pairwise similar sequences) (Amir)
	Note by Amir: Done, August 2013, but as far as I remember, we did not see any significant change (might need Claus's supervision)


Structural properties to consider

- From PDB structures
    * RSA (Dariya, Amir)		 			-- Done
    * RMSF (Dariya) 			 			-- Done (might need some clean-up)
    * RSA variability (Dariya)	 			-- Abandoned
    * b factors (Dariya)		 			-- (To be added)

- From MD
    * RMSF (Amir)						 	-- Done
    * mean RSA (Amir)					 	-- Done
    * other measures of RMSF (Amir)		 	-- Done (Dihedral angles)
    * RSA variability (Amir)			 	-- Done

- From Rosetta design
    * site variability, entropy (Eleisha)	-- Done
    * RSA variability (Eleisha)				-- Abandoned
