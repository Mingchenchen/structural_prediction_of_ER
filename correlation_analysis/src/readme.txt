This folder contains source codes for processing combined data from MD simulations (mainly done by Amir), homologous PDB structures (mainly done by Daria), and designed proteins (mainly done by Eleisha).

The term 'cor' wherever appears in the name of the files, stands for 'correlation'. The terms following 'cor' in the file names indicate the variables for which the correlation is measured for all pdb structures in the study.
